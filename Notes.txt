Approach 1 is to store all decka nd card data in a qlistwidgetitem
Approach 2 is to extern a list and use an adapter
I want to use an extern list of carddata (approach 2), but...
How do I select an item? if I assume that all names are unique
(which for flash cards they should be) then I could use that.
In fact, approach 1 would not allow me to easily gurantee a list was unique.
Well it's actually doable. Just alot of code.

Infact. A third approach just hit me. Why not just make two classes that inherit from
qlistwidgetitem and pass them to the qlistwidget.

Replace custom dialog with a QAbout dialog??

-Implement
Xrandomize copied list
Xguarantee no unique names (in deck)
Xfix renaming not saving bug for decks
Xdelete file when you delete deck
X--Use /.local directory to store data.
Xhandles mutiple users, AND mutiple apps, a demo so a flash cards are moved over (NOTE THIS IN THE END OF DEMO DIALOG)
XAdd demo mode
keyboard shortcuts for slideshow, both asdw and arrow keys
disable dragging the windows by the border to expand/shrink
allow slideshow to run with cards flipped, how ctrl-r?

Add?
Add spanish characters-most people would use a character map
flipped idicator?
paid card packs as dlc?

-Add shortcuts
MainDialog
ctrl-s to start cardslideshow

CardSlideShow

d next card
