Approach 1 is to store all decka nd card data in a qlistwidgetitem
Approach 2 is to extern a list and use an adapter
I want to use an extern list of carddata (approach 2), but...
How do I select an item? if I assume that all names are unique
(which for flash cards they should be) then I could use that.
In fact, approach 1 would not allow me to easily gurantee a list was unique.
Well it's actually doable. Just alot of code.

Infact. A third approach just hit me. Why not just make two classes that inherit from
qlistwidgetitem and pass them to the qlistwidget.

Replace custom dialog with a QAbout dialog??

-Implement
randomize copied list
guarantee no unique names

Add?
Add spanish characters-most people would use a character map

-Misc Design Notes
--Use /.local directory to store data.
handles mutiple users, AND mutiple apps, a demo so a flash cards are moved over (NOTE THIS IN THE END OF DEMO DIALOG)

-Add shortcuts
MainDialog
ctrl-s to start cardslideshow

CardSlideShow
a last card
d next card
s flip card
w save card (reshuffle back, default state as front again)
