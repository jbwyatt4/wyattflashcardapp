# Wyatt Flash Card App

Just a simple Qt Flashcard App I made to help me learn Spanish.

## Benefits:

* Decks-group cards by different categories
* Use the Deck viewer to quiz yourself one by one (supports quizing in reverse)
* Lite, simple, loads fast, quick to use

## Future Features:

* Change name away from Wyatt to something else
* Add Pictures to flash cards
* Add Youtube video link demoing how to use it (or better embedded)
